## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(here)
```


```{r crime}
crime <- read_csv(here::here("Data_Tables_Criminal_Incidents_Visualisation_Year_Ending_December_2019 (2).csv"))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r driving-plot, echo=FALSE}
dgr_driving <- crime %>% filter(`Offence Subgroup` == "A81 Dangerous driving") 


dgr_driving %>% 
  mutate(Year = as.factor(Year)) %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_col(aes(x = Year, y = `Incidents Recorded`))
```
